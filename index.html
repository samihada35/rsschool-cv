<h3>Summary </h3>
<p>My name is Vitalik, and for over 4 years I have been working in the IT field. At the moment I work as a project manager and analyst for quality of management.
I started developing for the first time a long time ago when I began to study JS and PHP to help in the implementation of projects. At that time, I worked in a small web studio, where everyone was a PM, a developer, and a tester.
After that, I got into a large international company, where I still work.
However, the desire to program has not gone anywhere, and I am pursuing the dream of becoming a developer of mobile applications and mobile games.</p>
